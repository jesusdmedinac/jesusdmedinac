I am a Software Engineer specialized in mobile app development. I specialize in Android with Kotlin, the official programming language for creating Android apps. I have worked on both private projects and public applications. I believe that all problems can be solved through a mobile device.

You too can create solutions to problems around you. Whether you want to work on a high-impact team or help your community, developing mobile apps will allow you to build a better future around you.

I can help you start your career or switch careers. I teach you how to develop mobile apps and professional websites. Become a Software Engineer. Learning to code can become the tool you needed to build a better future, get better job opportunities, improve your quality of life, and/or fulfill your purpose in life.
